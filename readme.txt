This project is to using convolutional neural network to recognize hand written digit in MNIST
database.
1. unzip package
2. run cnn.py
It will take about 2 hours to train and test all data in database.
Finally, after 50 epochs, it will show the best training and testing results in which iteration, also
give the time of all process.
